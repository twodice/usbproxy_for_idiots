USBProxy for morons
A beginners guide for USBProxy/usb-mitm intended for absolute beginners with minimal preexisting experience.



Read this and other docs first
	Read this the whole way before you do anything else, it may cost less this way.
	Watch dominicgs's Shmoocon presentation about usb-mitm on youtube

Obtain hardware needed
	Shopping list
		BeagleBoneBlack
		USB hub (BBB has only one USB host port)
		Power supply(s) for BBB & USB hub (5V)
		Asst USB cables
		Ethernet cable
		MicroSD card (4gb or above. Ebay ones might be fake. Local electronics/office shops are much easier to return faulty hardware to.)
		MicroSD reader (Cheap USB SD/MicroSD readers are a few dollars including shipping on Ebay.)
		Display with HDMI input
		HDMI cable (MicroHDMI to whatever your screen uses)
		Proper USB keyboard & mouse (trust me, you don't want to this using a media center keyboard/mouse combo)
		#USB flash drive 1GB+ (For moving recorded USB dumps around)


Set up hardware
	Unbox
	Plug USB hub into BBB
	Plug keyboard and mouse into USB hub
	Plug BBB into your display
	Plug BBB and USB hub into power supply(s)
	Plug BBB into your computer

Turn on BBB
	Put MicroSD card into BBB (You may need to temporarily unplug the HDMI cable to do this)
	Turn on your display and make sure it's set to the HDMI input you plugged the BBB into
	Press buttons on BBB then wait a while


Log in to BBB
	USERNAME: "debian"
	PASSWORD: "temppwd"


Find out your BBB's IP address
	Run this command on the BBB
		"ip addr show"
	It will probably be something similar to 192.168.x.x
	Copy your one down.
	This address may change if you power off or disconnect your BBB.


Connect via SSH
	This lets us keep giving commands.
	The USB port won't be any good to control the BBB while usb-mitm is running.
	Windows:
		PuTTY:
			Install PuTTY. (http://www.ninite.com makes this easy)
			Start PuTTY.
			Set "Host Name (or IP address)" field to the IP address of the BBB (Found using an earlier section).
			Port should be "22".
			Connection type should be "SSH".
			Click the open button at the bottom.
			When prompted to, type in the username "debian" and then press enter/return.
			When prompted to, type in the username "temppwd" and then press enter/return.
			The bottommost line should now show "debian@arm:~$"
			You are now connected and logged in to the BBB via SSH.
	Ubuntu:
		TODO FIXME


Build usb-mitm from source on BBB
	Run these commands on the BBB in this order:
		cd ~/USBProxy/src/
		make


Run usb-mitm
	Needs to be run with elevated priveliges.
	You may be prompted to enter your password. If so, the default is "temppwd".
	-l makes captured data print to console.
	-w <filename> savees output to pcap file for wireshark.
	So appending "-w usb.pcap" will save a wireshark-compatible record to a file in the current directory called "usb.pcap".
	UNTESTED: If you instead append "-w ~usb.pcap" the file will be saved into your home directory and will be easy to find
	Run this command:
	 	sudo ~/USBProxy/src/usb-mitm -l -w usb.pcap
 	To exit usb-mitm:
 		Press Ctrl-C in terminal


Collect your data for analysis
	Windows:
		Wireshark (Good for an overview, has timestamps):
			Install WinSCP. (http://www.ninite.com makes this easy)
			Use WinSCP to copy saved pcap dump to your computer
			Open the folder you copied the dump to.
			Open pcap dump in wireshark by double clicking the dump file.
		Console log (How I actually seem to be getting results and searching for stuff):
			Take log of PuTTY session and open it in a text editor
			Sublime text is good for this.


Interpret data
	???
	I'm still learning to do this.
	Python is your friend.
	LibUSB is tricky to set up but also your friend (Lets you talk to the usb stuff instead of just watching).
